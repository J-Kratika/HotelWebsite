      <h2>The History of hotel</h2>
      <p class="para">A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts,
           gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services.

<h3>Great loaction</h3>
 <p class="para1"> n a real estate boom, homebuyers will clamor for almost any house that hits the market. This is great while it lasts, but when the party's over, only homebuyers who choose the best locales will be holding the most valuable property 
     that also depreciates at a much slower rate. This difference in value is largely a result of a home's location.
        "Location, location, location" is a common mantra in real estate. And it's good advice—except for one thing: Most people have no idea what it really means.</div>
